We started this trip on 5th April 2024 from Ludhiana. During the trip, we passed through Pathankot and then we entered Jammu & Kashmir and that is where beauty began. We had lunch there at some local dhaba. We also had some conversations with the owner about the trip. However, he just gave us anxiety that Ladakh will as it was off-season. However, we continued our journey and reached Srinagar by 10.30 PM. The time reached we had to go through many hotels and at 11 we finally got one to stay. The next day, we got up in the early morning due to a Quran recitation going on in a nearby mosque. We had breakfast near Dal Lake. Clicked some of the photos. However, we didn't have a ride on Shikaras because our destination was something else as planned. So we continued our journey further.

## Khaltsi (Ladakh)

Now it was time to enter Ladakh but before entering there, we experienced something that I never got to experience. It was the farm of sunflowers!

After that we passed through Sonmarg, then at 7 PM we entered Khaltsi and then we got a room, and had dinner, I made some friends there and clicked photos with them. Now next day we had a real view of Khaltsi.
